# Klagenfurt_PhD_programming

#### According to the requirement, we modified :  
  1. Implement KNN classifier
  2. Add F1 score

#### Files include:  
1. shopping_yuner_xuan.py  
  The KNN classifier is based on the Kd-tree imported from scipy package.  

2. shopping_yuner_xuan_kd.py  
  We implement Kd-tree in python based on some existing codes. Although it is much slower than the one in scipy package, it still works.
